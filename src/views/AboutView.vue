    <p>
      Shiva Feshareki (1987) is a British-Iranian composer, artist and turntablist, described as
      “the most cutting-edge expression of turntablism” and as “one of the most astonishing acts of
      musical alchemy of the last decade” (BBC Radio 3’s Tom Service). Over the last decade, she has
      been a pioneer at the leading edge of both contemporary classical and electronic music scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She holds a Doctorate of Music in composition from the Royal College of Music (2017), and is
      winner of the BBC Young Composer’s Award (2004), The Royal Philharmonic Society Composition
      Prize (2009) and the Ivor Novello Award for Innovation (2017). Shiva is currently a Visiting
      Fellow at Oxford University with the Electronic Music Practice Research group (EMPRes) and
      funded by The Oxford Research Centre in the Humanities (TORCH), researching and presenting
      state-of-the-art spatial and ambisonic electronic composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      She has performed extensively across the world in concert halls, art galleries, festivals and
      raves, with notable appearances at BBC Proms (Royal Albert Hall), The Tanks at Tate Modern,
      Southbank, Barcelona’s Sonar Festival, the Moscow Museum of Modern Art (VAC Foundation), Casa
      Del Lago (Mexico), Hyperreality Festival of Club Culture (Vienna), Mutek in Montreal,
      Artheater/Frau Musica Nova (Cologne), Maerzmusik (Kraftwerk, Berlin), Amsterdam Dance Event
      (ADE), Stavanger Konserthus, and Hellerau (European Centre for the Arts). She most recently
      featured at the Design Museum Electronic Music Exhibition, which was held in London until the
      end of May 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shiva has also worked alongside a number of notable artists and ensembles including the London
      Contemporary Orchestra, BBC Singers, BBC Concert Orchestra, London Sinfonietta, Vienna Radio
      Symphony Orchestra, National Youth Choir, London Philharmonic Orchestra, Aarhus Symphony
      Orchestra, Ensemble Modern, Netherlands Chamber Choir, Düsseldorfer Symphoniker, Britten
      Sinfonia, Haroon Mirza, Kit Downes, Natalie Clein, Simon Fisher-Turner, Akiko Ahrendt,
      Microhm, Cathy Eastburn, Yoshi Sodeoka, Lee Gamble and Arlo Parks.

      Describing Shiva’s music is far from straightforward, when the breadth of expression, and
      range of compositions encompasses everything from orchestral, solo, choral, chamber,
      electronic and interdisciplinary installation works. At the core of her work, Shiva creates
      experiences that reveal the fluid and infinite interplay between sound and the physics of
      space; the interconnection between the essential nature of sound and our living experiences.
      Shiva uses an array of technology from vintage analogue tape echo, vinyl turntables, CDJs to
      state-of-the-art 360° ambisonic technology. Her tools also extend beyond electronic
      technology, using her own advanced 3D orchestration methods to score acoustic instruments in
      spatialized form, described as “A terrific sonic experience… Among her musical ideas there’s
      thrash metal and dance music, as well as marvellously fresh-sounding orchestral-gestures,
      assaulting or beguiling the audience from all angles” (Richard Morrison - Chief music critic
      of The Times).
    </p>
    <p>
      Undeniable influences include avant-garde electronic music of the late 20th Century, and
      electronic dance music, which she cross-pollinates in a formidable and uncompromising manner.
      This is best exemplified in her prowess as a turntablist, of which her talent mirrors that of
      her extraordinary compositional abilities, and of which she has made radical contributions to
      the art of turntabling – taking experimentation with the turntables to its limit, whilst still
      producing music that is universally relatable across a diversity of audiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two significant projects Shiva undertook in recent years include the realisation of Daphne
      Oram’s visionary Still Point with the London Contemporary Orchestra at the 2018 BBC Proms,
      which had been unheard since its inception in 1948, and also aiding in the organisation of
      premieres of Eliane Radigue’s works, most notably curating a concert of her works within a
      cave. Radigue and Oram are also two key influences on Shiva’s music, alongside Pauline
      Oliveros, James Tenney, Iannis Xenakis, Jungle, Drum and Bass, IDM, Baroque and Classical
      music, minimalism, analogue pop music, psychology, physics, geometry, architecture, philosophy
      and hermeneutics!
    </p>
    <p>
      Shiva’s underlying philosophy is equally as profound as the music she produces. Exceedingly
      aware of the cultural crises, and the self-actualisation she has had to manifest to confront
      conventions as an ethnic minority female in a largely white and patriarchal music culture, her
      music is a direct response to the issues many of us currently face as artists and as humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps this is best reflected in her recent work OPUS INFINITY (2019) for turntables and
      orchestra, where the performers (the Ensemble Modern), who perform from within the audience,
      are positioned across the acoustic space in relation to the proportions of Fibonacci spirals,
      which also govern the musical material. The possibilities within this physical, musical and
      spiritual spiral are infinite, and each performance of the work becomes an entirely new
      experience, influenced by the performance space, the performers, and the musical responses
      generated. To accomplish something this daring, Shiva uses vinyl turntables with vintage
      analogue tape echo, CDJs and state-of-the-art 360° ambisonic technology, that not only make it
      possible for her to open up an extensive and otherworldly soundscape, but also to control
      performer reactions in real time, using their positions across the music space to aid in this
      qualitative calculation.

      Shiva’s latest output includes a focus on works for 3D immersive electronics and choir which
      include ‘Aetherworld’ premiered by Shiva and the BBC Singers at the Royal Albert Hall for the
      BBC Proms 2021. ‘Aestherworld’ was later featured on Shiva’s critically acclaimed album
      ‘Turning World’, listed as The Guardian’s Contemporary Album of the Month.
