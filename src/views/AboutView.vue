      Studio Feshareki is a sound art studio producing live performances, digital projects and
      installation works centered around the bold compositions of Shiva Feshareki.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through her studio, Shiva Feshareki brings modular immersive sound systems into different
      spaces - from concert halls, exhibitions, to unusual places - where she performs her unique
      spatial compositions that intertwine ambisonic turntablism with immersive acoustic
      composition. The works manifest live-in-the-moment, encapsulating the qualities and
      specifications of each space to create epic experiences that bring the place to life in new
      dimensions.

      Shiva Feshareki (1987) is a British-Iranian composer, artist and turntablist, described as
      “the most cutting-edge expression of turntablism” and as “one of the most astonishing acts of
      musical alchemy of the last decade” (BBC Radio 3). Over the last decade, she has been a
      pioneer at the leading edge of both contemporary classical and electronic music scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her inventive approach has ignited a revolution in performance and spatial composition, paving
      the way for a new wave of artists and immersive productions, bringing together diverse
      audiences in a cross-pollination that has changed the landscape of the industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is most apparent in her extensive catalog of works from her earlier compositions such as
      GABA-analogue (2015), O (2016) and Opus Infinity (2019) where orchestra’s are spatialized and
      entered by the audience, to her latest projects including the “mind-bending” TRANSFIGURE
      (2022), the first ever live ambisonic composition brought to London’s Barbican Centre (Sunday
      Times). Her album Turning World was labelled the Guardian’s Contemporary Album of the Month
      following the critically acclaimed performance of her Aetherworld (2021) at the BBC Proms,
      where she stood inside the audience arena “sending blasts of electronic sound rippling round
      the hall” in duet with the BBC Singers (The Times). Sama-zan Trip (2022) was premiered by
      Shiva with the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra combining Live Ambisonic Turntablism with
      Symphony Orchestra in a highly ambitious spatial work installed inside the Helmut List Halle
      (Graz).
    </p>
    <p>
      As an innovator, experimenter and a self-described sonic architect, Shiva is fascinated by the
      materiality of sound. Her intrepid exploration of a 360-degree sound world encompasses
      compositions for orchestral, solo, choral, chamber, electronic and interdisciplinary
      installation works. She also composes for ‘note reading’ ensembles where she re-theorises
      relationships between performer and audience, dissolving physical, historical, and sonic
      boundaries. In her live electronic compositions, she fearlessly warps time and space through
      the boundless possibility of her turntables, masterfully contorting samples of her own
      compositions along with peculiarities from her LP collection. She employs an array of
      technology from vintage analogue tape echo, vinyl turntables, CDJs, to state-of-the-art
      ambisonic technology to create experiences that reveal the fluid and infinite interplay
      between sound and the physics of space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her acoustic and electronic compositions are deeply intertwined, often combining fixed and
      improvised elements responding to one another and intricately influenced by the acoustics and
      energy of a space. This hybrid approach has placed Shiva at the forefront of electronic,
      acoustic and spatial composition. The underlying philosophy of Shiva’s work is equally as
      profound as the music she produces. Exceedingly aware of the cultural crises, and the
      self-actualisation she has had to manifest to confront conventions as an ethnic minority
      female in a largely white and patriarchal music culture, her music is a direct response to the
      issues many of us currently face as artists and as humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      She has performed extensively across the world in concert halls, art galleries, festivals and
      raves, with notable appearances at BBC Proms (Royal Albert Hall, London), the Tanks at Tate
      Modern (London), Southbank Centre (London), Barbican Centre (London), De Bijloke (Ghent),
      Helmut List Halle (Graz), Dom-im-Berg (Graz), Sonar Festival (Barcelona), the Moscow Museum of
      Modern Art (VAC Foundation, Moscow), Casa Del Lago (Mexico City), Mutek (Montreal),
      Hyperreality Festival of Club Culture / Vienna Festwochen (Vienna), Maerzmusik / Berliner
      Festspiele (Kraftwerk, Berlin), Hellerau (European Centre for the Arts, Dresden),
      Kunstfestspiele Herrenhausen (Hannover), Spor Festival (Aarhus), Amsterdam Dance Event,
      Stavanger Konserthus and ​​SNF Nostos (Athens).
    </p>
    <p>
      Shiva has performed her works alongside the BBC Singers, BBC Concert Orchestra, London
      Sinfonietta, London Philharmonic Orchestra, London Contemporary Orchestra, Ensemble Modern,
      Netherlands Chamber Choir, Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra, Düsseldorfer Symphoniker, Haroon
      Mirza, Yoshi Sodeoka and Arlo Parks to name just a few.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2022, Shiva released her critically acclaimed album Turning World on NMC, earning the title
      of the Guardian’s Contemporary Album of the Month. The Observer praised her for her “restless
      invention” and described the record as “beautiful and bewitching”. BBC Music Magazine
      described it as “a bold and fascinating Josquin-inspired sonic landscape”, labelling Shiva as
      “the innovator who doesn't try to be original”.
